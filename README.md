# CS421: Machine Learning

Task: Classify fraudulent users based on movie reviews

Data is published on a weekly basis, and labels for previous weeks are made available after submissions and metrics
have been computed.

The task is to optimize the classification model on a weekly basis, where the training sets get progressively more
challenging with time.
